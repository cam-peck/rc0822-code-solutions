// create four player obects, each player has name: 'name-here' and hand: 'cards-here' data.
// create array of 52 objects, each object needs a rank and suit
// we're lazy, so we're going to use JS to create the deck for us
// declare an empty array to store our object in named 'deck'
// declare an array of all four suits named 'suits'
// declare an array of all values from Ace --> King named 'values'
// iterate through suits first, and values second.
// at each element of values, push an object with the suit and value to the deck
// when finished iterating, should have deck of 52 cards.
